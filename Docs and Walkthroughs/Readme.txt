
These are walkthrough guides that I was tasked with creating in order to allow members of the team to carry out new actions or tasks they haven’t used before. 

I developed this template as it allowed me to lay out instructional steps in a clear and concise manner, I also included a font style that would separate code in a manner that was clear and could also be easily copied to the clipboard for insertion into a cli program. 

These documents are now used by the team and distributed through a SharePoint for those who need it. The document format has been integrated into the team as a standard operating procedure document which other team members use when creating walkthrough guides as the Project Manager felt it was a good document that could easily be used by anyone of any level.
